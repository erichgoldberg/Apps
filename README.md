Apps
====

Completed Apps or functional parts for making them.

Code for:
Windows Phone 7
Windows Phone 8
Windows 8

Using Visual Studio Ultimate 2012 and (sometimes) Blend for Visual Studio.

The goal for this is simply to share completed projects and useful examples of functionalities that might be 
put together by anyone to make their own stuff.

Will update when I remember.
